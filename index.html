			<h2> About Me</h2>
			<p> Hey there! My name is Jack and I am currently studying Computer Science at University of California, Irvine with an expected graduation date of 2018. I am pursing entry level software related jobs at the moment. Feel free to check out my resume, check out some of my links at the bottom of the page, or send me an email at <u>jfmurray@uci.edu</u>.     
			<br>
			<br>
			A little bit about myself. I grew up in Manhattan Beach, CA until the first grade when I moved into a ranch with my parents in Temecula, CA (the horse is mine, but not the raptor). Being isolated out in the middle of nowhere for a large portion of my life is what lead to my passion in technology and eventually pursue a degree in computer science. Besides that, I enjoy video games, sports (Go Eagles!), and just learning something new.

					<h3> FabFlix </h3>
					<p class = "projectText">
						Fabflix is a dynamic web application I worked on last year that stores dvds with their info such as: release dates, stars, and genres, along with an personal accounts used to make purchases. I ultilized a MySQL database to store all of the dvd info along with relations between dvds, genres, and movie stars. Some other features include:
						
						 <ul>
						 	<li>Advanced searching using diffcult search queries. </li>
						 	<li>Pop-ups and Autosearch with Jquery</li>
						 	<li>A mobile application that connected to the web server</li>
						 </ul>

						 As for the rest of the technology I used Java servlets and jsp files to create dynamic webpages and hosted it on a Tomcat Server on an AWS EC2 instance.

The responses were sent back to the parent and agreed messages were saved on the childs phone.</p>
